    "Below is a proposed plan for creating cluster-based LIME explanations that will enable you to approximate local interpretability for entire groups of patients. The idea is to cluster patients by their Health Index (or by broader feature sets, if needed), then perform or average LIME explanations only on a small number of representative patients within each cluster. This allows you to retain LIME’s interpretative merits without having to compute individual local explanations for every single patient:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster Patients by Health Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a clustering method that suits your data size and distribution. For example, you might use K-means on the Health Index alone, or a more sophisticated approach (e.g. hierarchical or density-based clustering).\n",
    "Decide on the number of clusters k (or let the algorithm determine this adaptively).\n",
    "Once clustered, each patient belongs to exactly one cluster based on similarity in Health Index (and optionally a few other key features).\n",
    "Identify Cluster Representatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each cluster, you can pick:\n",
    "A cluster centroid (the average Health Index, and/or average feature values).\n",
    "A small sample of patients (e.g. a few median or “typical” points within that cluster).\n",
    "This step drastically reduces the number of patients for whom you need a separate local explanation.\n",
    "Apply LIME on These Representatives\n",
    "\n",
    "For each representative in each cluster, run LIME just as you normally would for a local explanation.\n",
    "Because LIME can be computationally expensive, you’ll only do it for these select patients, rather than every single patient in the dataset.\n",
    "Aggregate or Average Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve chosen multiple representatives in a cluster, you can average or combine their LIME feature weights to form a “cluster-level” explanation.\n",
    "This “average explanation” would then summarise which features are most influential in a typical local explanation for that cluster’s patient base.\n",
    "Assign These Explanations Back to the Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Each patient in a cluster is effectively assigned the cluster-level LIME explanation.\n",
    "Optionally record a measure of confidence or how well the cluster representative(s) reflect that patient.\n",
    "Refine and Validate\n",
    "\n",
    "If certain clusters appear too large or too heterogeneous, consider more granular sub-clusters (or revise your clustering parameters).\n",
    "Compare the performance of these “cluster-based” local explanations against fully individual LIME runs on a small test group. This will indicate how well your cluster-level approach approximates true local interpretability.\n",
    "By grouping patients in this manner, you save a huge amount of computational cost, as LIME is only performed on a carefully chosen subset of patients for each cluster. The resulting explanations, while not perfectly tailored to each individual, will still be locally relevant for patients within the same Health Index group (or similar feature pattern). This technique aims to balance interpretability (retaining LIME’s local insights) with scalability, ensuring you can handle large datasets without excessive runtime."
