xai_formatter.py

Utility script to format raw XAI explanation strings (e.g. from Anchors and LIME outputs)
into high-level, readable English. It parses inequality conditions and converts them
into descriptive sentences.

Usage:
    from xai_formatter import format_explanation
    raw_str = "â€¦"
    formatted = format_explanation(raw_str)
    print(formatted)
